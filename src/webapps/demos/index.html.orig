                <p>A search index refresh delay is OK for a website but not for many real time application including mobile apps.
                I should be able to search the recently added contact or 
                as we conference, upload a document and tell my collegue to find it by name xxx.

                <h3>Support for XML documents</h3>
                <p>Most of our records are stored in the relational databases. For a given service request,
                these records are stiched together and a XML is served out. How about indexing these XMLs
                and searching these XMLs by values combined with document types or field types.

                <h3>Search access control</h3>
                <p>Data access could be by user ids, teams, roles, organization units
                   or combination of these. If needed, the search can be scoped to logged in 
                   users along with assigned roles and responsibilities.

                <p>User should not be punished for fat fingering. HSearch supports synonums, 
                word genre,  detail infromation on the word, fuzzy based spell correction. 
                Along with this, you can also use the regular  expression to identify words 
                or present the list of words.

                <h3>Continuous Result Rank Tuning</h3>
                <p>Google ranking algorithm takes great advantage out of hyperlinked texts.
                   These hyper links are made by humans to browse a web of information and 
                   establishing importance, subject and various other parameters to it.
                   
                   However, in a enterprise data it is either absent or some time manually
                   induced to unnecessarily boost the document for marketting leverage.
                   Our rank algorithm continuously learns out of user behaviour, remember the
                   user searches keywords, clicked documents and spending time to read it to 
                   serve better next time.

                <p>
                Editorial team can attach keywords to a document, boost a document weight,
                remove keyword stuffing, as well as enable/disable the document from the index.

                Integrating to stand alone mobile apps or enterprise applications are very crusial
                for further development. We provide rest API which serves information in a XML

                <p>
                Our high reliablity comes from the underneath Hadoop infrastructure. As our
                index is stored there, automatically replication comes with this and provides
                high availability to your data. Along with this, we also take regular backup
                of our search index and can recover to one day lag state in a un forseen situations.
